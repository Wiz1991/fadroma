## [Fadroma CLI](./packages/cli)

**Your portal to the Fadroma universe.**

* `TODO` [ ] [`docker compose`-based project template and portable development environment](https://github.com/hackbg/fadroma/issues/52)

</td><td>

**This is what you need in `package.json`**
to be able to run Fadroma scripts.

```jsonc
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "cat": "ganesha-node cat.ts"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@hackbg/ganesha": "^1",
    "@hackbg/fadroma": "github:hackbg/fadroma"
  }
}
```

Because you don't need to type **environment variables** every time:

```sh
# .env
FADROMA_CHAIN=localnet-1.2
```

Because **you don't want your keys to leak**:

```sh
# .gitignore
.env
```

Then you can run **your Fadroma scripts** with:

```sh
pnpm cat do something    # basic form
pnpm -w cat do something # in workspace
# or...
yarn cat do something    # if using Yarn
npm run cat do something # if using NPM
```

> See [Fadroma CLI documentation](./packages/cli/README.md#example-deployment-script)
> for the big example.

## [Fadroma Ops](./packages/ops)

**Core workflows for smart contract
development and deployment
on Cosmos-based platforms.**

* The `Contract` and `Client` classes represent smart contracts
  and allow you to write scripts that compile them, deploy them,
  and interact with them.
* The `Deployment` and `Migration` system helps you keep track
  of groups of connected contracts that work together.
* The `Agent`'s `Bundle` mode allows you to run multiple
  transactions simultaneously - including contract instantiations.

</td><td>

**This is the format of a Fadroma script.**
It's a JavaScript or TypeScript module that
lets you define migrations as plain async functions
invoked by name from the command line.

```typescript
// cat.ts
import Fadroma from '@hackbg/fadroma'
Fadroma.command('do something',
  async function meow ({ agent }) {
    // go wild here
  })
// this line has to remain at the very end of the script
export default Fadroma.module(import.meta.url)
```

```typescript
// Needs example deployment workflow,
// with or without `Contract` ;)
```

## Fadroma Derive

**Attribute macros for writing smart contracts.**

CosmWasm's raw syntax is a little verbose. We wrap all the repetitive bits
into familiar tags such as `#[init]`, `#[handle]` and `#[query]`. The example on the right will generate an `InitMsg` struct, `HandleMsg` and `QueryMsg` enums, `init`, `handle` and `query` dispatch functions for those messages and WASM entry point boilerplate. In addition an empty struct called `DefaultImpl` with the trait implemented on it is generated that can be used to call these functions in Rust code (mostly useful for testing).

* For more info see [fadroma-derive-contract](./crates/fadroma-derive-contract)

</td><td>

```rust
#[contract(entry)]
pub trait Contract {
    #[init]
    pub fn new(config: Config)
        -> StdResult<InitResponse>
    {
        // your code here...
    }

    #[handle]
    pub fn set_config(config: Config)
        -> StdResult<HandleResponse>
    {
        // your code here...
    }

    #[query]
    pub fn get_config(config: Config)
        -> StdResult<ConfigResponse>
    {
        // your code here...
    }

    pub struct ConfigResponse {
       /* your code here */
    }
}
```

## Fadroma Composability

**Composable contract traits.**

Replicate the same management functionality across your whole fleet of contracts,
by implementing it as a reusable Rust trait.
