## Fadroma Ops

**Contract deployment workflow for Secret Network.**

Just import `@hackbg/fadroma` to start scripting deployments and migrations.

* [@fadroma/ops](./packages/ops)
* [@fadroma/scrt](./packages/scrt)
* [@fadroma/scrt-1.0](./packages/scrt-1.0)
* [@fadroma/scrt-1.2](./packages/scrt-1.2).
* Open to extension for other blockchains supporting a similar deployment model.

```typescript
import Fadroma, { Deploy } from '@hackbg/fadroma'
import MyContract from './MyContract'

const name = 'MyContract1'

Fadroma.command('deploy new',
  Deploy.new,
  async ({ chain, agent, deployment }) => {
    const contract = new MyContract({ name })
    await chain.buildAndUpload(agent, [contract])
    await deployment.init(agent, contract, {
      my_init_message: 'goes_here'
    })
    await contract.tx(agent, {
      my_handle_message: 'goes here'
    })
  })

Fadroma.command('deploy status',
  Deploy.current,
  async ({ chain, agent, deployment }) => {
    const contract = deployment.getThe(
      name,
      new MyContract({ name })
    )
    console.log(await contract.query(agent, {
      my_query_message: 'goes here'
    }))
  })
```

```sh
npx fadroma deploy new
npx fadroma deploy status
```

## Fadroma Derive

**Attribute macros for writing smart contracts.**

CosmWasm's raw syntax is a little verbose. We wrap all the repetitive bits
into familiar tags such as `#[init]`, `#[handle]` and `#[query]`.

* See [fadroma-derive-contract](./crates/fadroma-derive-contract)

## Fadroma Composability

**Composable contract traits.**

Replicate the same management functionality across your whole fleet of contracts,
by implementing it as a reusable Rust trait.

* See [fadroma-composability](./crates/fadroma-composability)
