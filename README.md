## Fadroma Ops

**Contract deployment workflow for Secret Network.**

Implemented in: [`@fadroma/ops`](./packages/ops) [`@fadroma/scrt`](./packages/scrt) [`@fadroma/scrt-1.0`](./packages/scrt-1.0) [`@fadroma/scrt-1.2`](./packages/scrt-1.2).

Just import `@hackbg/fadroma` to start scripting deployments and migrations.

* The `Contract` and `Client` classes represent smart contracts
  and allow you to write scripts that compile them, deploy them,
  and interact with them.
* The `Deployment` and `Migration` system helps you keep track
  of groups of connected contracts that work together.
* The `Agent`'s `Bundle` mode allows you to run multiple
  transactions simultaneously - including contract instantiations.
* Configuration file allows custom commands to be defined
  from reusable "deploy step" functions.
* Modular architecture, open to extension for other
  Cosmos-based blockchains.

   * because it's convenient. You can use free-standing
   * functions, too, and name them any way you like. */

    /* Easily bundle multiple transactions, including inits.
     * You can't do a query in the middle of the bundle,
     * and the API is kinda rough. But it works, and
     * speeds up procedures considerably. */

     * defined separately from deployment procedures, in
     * the `Client` class. After deploying or retrieving
     * a `Contract` object, consider passing around only
     * `Client`s bound to particular `Agent`s. */

## Fadroma Derive

**Attribute macros for writing smart contracts.**

CosmWasm's raw syntax is a little verbose. We wrap all the repetitive bits
into familiar tags such as `#[init]`, `#[handle]` and `#[query]`.

* See [fadroma-derive-contract](./crates/fadroma-derive-contract)

## Fadroma Composability

**Composable contract traits.**

Replicate the same management functionality across your whole fleet of contracts,
by implementing it as a reusable Rust trait.

* See [fadroma-composability](./crates/fadroma-composability)
